<h3 class="my-2">Statement</h3>
    <p>
       Phigaro is a curious child. Every day, he is studying his father`s books, as he wants to be a fameous mathmatician.
       <br>
       The child`s favourite subject is number theory. Therefore, Phigaro wonders, for every integer i between 1 and N, how many integers j are there, such that 1 <= j <= i and gcd(i, j)=1 ?
    </p>

    <h3 class="my-2">Input format</h3>
    <p>
        File phigaro.in contains, on the first line, one positive integer, N.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3 class="my-2">Output format</h3>
    <p>
        File phigaro.out should contain N integers on the first line.
        <br>
        The ith integers should represent the number of integers j, such that 1 <= j <= i and gcd(i,j)=1.
