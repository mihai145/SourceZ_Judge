# SourceZ_Judge

The judge behind SourceZ
-it checks every 3 seconds for a not judged submission
-if it gets a hit, it runs the checker against the submission
-after checking, it updates the submission score or the contest score accordingly

The bash script (evaluation script) can also be run locally (just pay attention to the absolute path to the checkerEnv folder at the top of the script).
